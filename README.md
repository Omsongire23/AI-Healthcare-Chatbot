AI-Powered Health Chatbot

About the Project

As a student passionate about Artificial Intelligence and healthcare, I developed this AI-Powered Health Chatbot to assist users by providing basic health advice and symptom monitoring. This chatbot is built using Streamlit and DialoGPT and aims to bridge the gap between users and quick health-related information. The project showcases my ability to integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) models into real-world applications, making healthcare assistance more accessible.

This chatbot can respond to user queries related to general health concerns, symptom analysis, fitness, and nutrition. It is designed as a prototype to demonstrate the potential of AI in healthcare.

Key Features

Instant Health Advice: Users can ask about common health concerns and receive AI-powered responses instantly.

Symptom Monitoring: The chatbot can analyze symptoms and provide basic guidance on possible causes and care.

User-Friendly Interface: The chatbot is built using Streamlit, making it easy to use and interactive.

AI-Based Responses: It leverages Microsoft DialoGPT to generate personalized and relevant answers.

Accessibilty: The application runs smoothly on a local machine and can be accessed via a web browser.
